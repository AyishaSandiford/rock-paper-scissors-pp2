# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

## How It Works?

The name of this game is Rock Paper Scissors. This game requires two players, Player One and The Computer.
Player One is given three options to make their play from and the computer will generate a random choice from these options.
Each Player will only be required to make one choice per game round.
The game options are Rock, Paper and Scissors. The first player to score 5 wins wins the over all game.

## What I was able to accomplish using JavaScript
For this project, instead of creating multiple html pages to display the different pages of the game, I created different sections
in one html file and used CSS and Javascript to make them hidden and/or reappear by the click of a button. This was achieved by using
EventListeners in Javascript to 'listen' for the assigned button click to revealed each appropriate section. Javascript allowed me to
create functions. I was able to call these functions throughout my application allowing them to execute the code written within.
Using Javascript I was able to generate a random number from 0-2 and use these values to allow the computer to make plays against the player.
This gaves the player the feel of playing with a real life user adding excitement since you dont know what the player will chose.
Using Javascript I was able to increase the scores of each player and the Rounds as the game is played. I enjoyed creating this project and using Javascript.

## Features

When you visit the site you are taken to the Introduction Screen. This Screen Welcomes you to the game and clearly displays the name of the game. An image of two hands playing Rock, Paper, Scissors helps give you an indication of the games nature. Two buttons are below this image. These will take you to the 'How to play' screen with instructions and rules on the game. The 'Start' button will take you to the game page where you can start playing the game.

## How To Play Screen

This screen has a simple layout which explains how to play the game and gives you the rules of the game. There is a 'Back' button that takes
you back to the Home screen.

## The Game Screen

This is where the game is played. The name of the Game is shown to the top of the page and three buttons labeled Rock Paper and Scissors are displayed below. These are the choices given to the player to play the game.

Below this, a box displays the Rounds and the choices that were chosen by both the player and computer.

As the game is played the round will continue to show the current round that is being played and the round that will be played next.

Both the user and computer scores are tracked and displayed for the user.

The reset button allows the user the reset the game and bring all scores to 0 and rounds back to Round 1. (This can only be used if a player has not yet
scored 5 wins.

The Home button takes you back to the Home Screen. This button will also reset all scores returning them to their original state.

After a player reaches 5 wins the play Buttons: Rock paper and Scissors will become disabled. Text will appear announcing the Winner of the match
in the rounds box.

At this time they're two buttons enabled, the Home Button and the Play Again Button. These buttons will both reset the game
However, the Home button will take you to the home screen and the Play again button will allow the user to remain on the game screen
as to start a new game.
